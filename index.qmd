We could provide a templated listing of instructors here (or on its own page), similar to [DS100/fa23](https://github.com/DS-100/fa23).

## Schedule

Note: DS100 uses templating to fill out the schedule. Here we use Quarto's EJS templating.

The templating is basically working in terms of filling in values in the schedule.ejs file based on a schedule.yml file.
