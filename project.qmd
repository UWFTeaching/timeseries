title: IDC 6940 - Capstone Projects in Data Science
subtitle: "Project Instructions"
---

Please read the following instructions:

You will need to select a specific study area to concentrate on, which may be a subject new to you. You will start the process by conducting an in-depth exploration of the chosen topic and then demonstrate the application of the new methodology using a real-world dataset that is both relevant and captivating. Completing the project requires submitting a comprehensive written paper alongside an engaging oral presentation supported by slides.
